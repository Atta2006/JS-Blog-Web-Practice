The site is live at https://atta2006.github.io/JS-Blog-Web-Practice/
In creating this personal blog website, my primary focus was on practicing JavaScript and showcasing my skills as a beginner front-end developer. The design was kept straightforward to emphasize functionality, allowing me to explore JavaScript concepts like event handling, form processing, and local storage. Using Bootstrap for structure and styling, I built a simple and interactive platform where users can create, categorize, and view blog posts.

I'm eager to learn and improve, so I'd love to hear your ideas for enhancing this project. Whether it's adding new features, improving the user interface, or exploring advanced JavaScript topics, I'm open to suggestions. Your feedback will help me continue my journey as a front-end developer and build more engaging projects in the future.
